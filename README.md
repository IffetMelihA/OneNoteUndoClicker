# OneNote Undo Button Clicker
**OS**: Windows 11 <br />
**Computer Model**: Dell XPS 13 9310 2in1 Undo Button Clicker for OneNote <br />
**Pen**: Dell PN7522W <br />

This pen does not provide a undo funciton. One note also does not have a shortcut for undo. My brother wanted to do undo without having to click on the undo button manually. So, I created this automatic undo button clicker for him to undo his sketches in One Note without manually having to do that himself.
